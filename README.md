# CallCode-Phone-Number-Formatter
The Phone Number Formatter is a simple web application that helps users quickly and accurately format phone numbers based on country dialing codes.


Project Overview
The Phone Number Formatter is a simple web application that helps users quickly and accurately format phone numbers based on country dialing codes.
It accepts raw phone number inputs—whether local or international formats—and standardizes them by:

Removing unnecessary characters like (0), spaces, or special symbols

Handling different international prefixes such as 00

Adding or correcting country codes (e.g., +31 for Netherlands)

Producing clean, consistent phone numbers in the international E.164 format

This tool is especially useful for businesses, developers, and telecommunication apps that require consistent phone number formatting for storage, display, or API use.

How It Works
The user pastes or types a phone number into the input box.

The user selects the country code from a dropdown menu.

When the user clicks Get, the app:

Removes (0) used in national numbers

Cleans all special characters except digits

Strips unnecessary leading zeros and 00 international prefixes

Adds the selected country code correctly, ensuring proper international format

The formatted phone number is displayed in a read-only textarea below for easy copy or further use.

Why This Project Is Useful
Data consistency: Phone numbers are notoriously inconsistent. This tool ensures that phone numbers are saved and used in a uniform format, avoiding duplicates or errors.

International compatibility: Prepares phone numbers for global use, APIs, or systems that require the E.164 international phone number format.

Saves time: Automates tedious manual cleanup and formatting, increasing user efficiency.

Extensible: Easily extendable to support hundreds of countries and custom rules for different telecom scenarios.

Learning value: Demonstrates practical JavaScript skills, DOM manipulation, regex use, and real-world input validation.

How to Use
Open index.html in a modern browser.

Paste or type any phone number into the input field.

Select the correct country code from the dropdown.

Click the Get button or press Enter.

Copy the formatted phone number from the textarea below.

Tech Stack
HTML5 and semantic markup for structure.

CSS3 for styling with responsive design principles.

JavaScript (ES6+) for input validation, string processing, and DOM interaction.

Future Improvements
Add search and autocomplete in the country dropdown for better UX with 100+ countries.

Validate phone number length and format per country.

Integrate with third-party phone validation APIs.

Save formatted numbers locally or export CSV for bulk processing.
